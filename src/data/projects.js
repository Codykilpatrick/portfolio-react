    description: "Hnefatafl is a chess-like board game where white's goal is to protect their king and get them to safety while black's goal is to stop this at all costs! This variation is played on an 11x11 board with the four corners being the refuge or goal spaced for white. All pieces are able to move only in straight lines from their current location up until they reach the edge or are blocked by another piece. All pieces can be captured if they are sandwiched between two opposing pieces either vertically or horizontally.",
