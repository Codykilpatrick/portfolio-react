    description: "Hnefatafl is a chess-like board game where white's goal is to protect their king and get them to safety while black's goal is to stop this at all costs! This variation is played on an 11x11 board with the four corners being the refuge or goal spaced for white. All pieces are able to move only in straight lines from their current location up until they reach the edge or are blocked by another piece. All pieces can be captured if they are sandwiched between two opposing pieces either vertically or horizontally.",

    title: "Tackling Power Line faults with supervised Machine Learning",
    description: "The main objective of the analysis is to build a model that will determine if a power line is faulted and what type of fault it is. This project directly benefits the business by creating tripwires for response generations immediately when a fault occurs instead of waiting for an outside report. It also creates a more informed on-site technician. With knowledge of the fault type the technician is able to plan, gather appropriate tools and the required number of people. This tool also assists the plant managers. If a fault is observed, they can take immediate action on the distribution of power to ensure zero downtime for customers.",
