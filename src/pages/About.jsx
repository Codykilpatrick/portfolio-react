      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome! I have spent the last nine years serving the U.S Navy as a Sonar Technician on surface ships. I was on two different ships and did three deployments all to the middle-east. After that I went to two different shore facilities in Virginia and Japan!
      </p>

        I am proud to have served but at the end of the day I didn't want to be apart from my wife and our puppy Sushi anymore. In the final months of service I decided to take the dive into Software Engineering!
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now I want to take my new found skills and create products that will make life easier and more efficient for sailors. I think right now with the skills I am learning combined with my previous experience gives me the ability to create actionable tools for sailors everywhere.
